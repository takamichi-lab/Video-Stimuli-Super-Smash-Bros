This repository contains the open-source dataset published in the short paper at IEEE CoG 2025.

## Creating a dataset
The video set for this experiment was created based on 32 one-on-one videos collected from [SMASH corpus](https://ss-takashi.sakura.ne.jp/corpus/smash/).
SMASH corpus includes match videos (without audio), commentary audio, and CSV files annotated with speech start and end times as well as topic tags.
